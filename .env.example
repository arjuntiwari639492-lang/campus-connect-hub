# Example environment variables for local development.
# Copy this file to .env (or .env.local) at the project root and fill in
# the real values. Do NOT commit your real .env file if it contains secrets.

# Supabase: client-facing URL and anon/public key (safe to expose to client)
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-ref.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOi...your-anon-key...

# Optional: server-only (do not expose these to client code)
# SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key

# Notes:
# - Vite only exposes variables prefixed with VITE_ to client code via import.meta.env.
# - After creating/updating .env, restart the dev server: npm run dev
# - For deployment, set these environment variables in your hosting provider (Netlify, Vercel, etc.)
